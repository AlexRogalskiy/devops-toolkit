## Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes

This book was removedx from sales since I believe that Jenkins X is a much better choice for running CD in Kubernetes while Jenkins (without X)
 continues dominating everything else.

That does not mean that Jenkins is not great, but rather that I am currently focused on Jenkins X and cannot keep both books up-to-date. Those interested in CD in
Kubernetes might want to consider [The DevOps 2.6 Toolkit: Jenkins X](/posts/devops-26).
